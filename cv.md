## About myself
My work experience has taught me how to interact with a team, work with large amounts of information and separate the main from the secondary.

After moving to another city, there was a desire to try myself in other areas of activity. I came to programming after communication and recommendations from friends and acquaintances. This area contains a lot of new, constantly changing information, which allows the neural connections in the head to work. 

My purpose is to learn and grow into a top-grade frontend developer.
